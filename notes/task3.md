# CORE: Planning
## Description

Follow the [planning process](https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/js-front-end/planning-react-apps) for building a React app. You should create wireframes for each route, as well planning the component tree with associated state.

### Here are some project-specific things to bear in mind:

- Have a look at your API endpoints. Think about what data you have available, and how you will structure your application. What routes will your application have? What articles will you choose to display on the main page?
Think how you will isolate the concerns of your project - the structure of your components, the sourcing of your data, the styling.

- What sort of routing will your app use? What sort of specificity do you think you will need? Remember, your URLs don't have to directly correspond to your API endpoints, but they will provide some guidance.

- Think about what data each component will need. Where will it come from? When should components find their own data and when should they load it themselves? Focus on the simplest functionality first.

- Authentication is something we do not have on our back end. 
You should hardcode a logged-in user.

- Consider more complex functionality: how do you want to allow changes to your database? Think about how you will attribute users to posted comments etc. How will you know what comments/articles a user should be allowed to delete? How about sorting data, or paginating responses? A good starting point would be to pick a single user and assume that all new articles and comments are being posted by that user.

- How are you going to make this a fluid and engaging experience for users so they want to come back for more?

- Once you have completed your plan, download it as an image (or take a screenshot) and add the file to your project. Submit the pull request as usual so we can give you some feedback on your plan.

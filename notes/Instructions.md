# FE project - Northcoders News

## Overview
### Background
This sprint should consolidate your understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.

You'll be creating Northcoders News - a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.

### Git Branching and Pull Requests
You will be working on each ticket on a new branch.

To create and switch to a new git branch, use the command:

`git checkout -b <new branch name>`

This will create a branch and move over to that branch. (Omit the -b flag if you wish to switch to an already existing branch).

We recommend that you name the branch something that clearly shows the ticket you are working on, e.g. fe-ncnews-display-articles

When pushing the branch to GitHub, ensure that you make reference to the branch you are pushing to on the remote.

`git push origin <branch name>`

From GitHub, you can make a pull request and share the link and ticket number on your nchelp. A tutor will review your code and either approve it or leave you comments on what changes should be made.

Once a pull request been accepted, be sure to switch back to the main branch and pull down the updated changes.

`git checkout main`

`git pull origin main`

You can tidy up your local branches once they have been pulled into main by deleting them:

`git branch -D <local branch>`

### Outline of Core Tasks

You will only be able to complete front end tickets that have the associated behaviour implemented in your back end application.

We suggest that you complete all the core tasks on your front end that you are able to at this stage. Once you have done this, you are welcome to return to your back end project one ticket at a time to allow you to continue with front end tickets.

To view each task in detail, you can click the navigation buttons on the left-hand side of the screen. You do not need to have completed a challenge to view the next one.
